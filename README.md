==========

A website and framework that tracks changes in online news articles over time.


Running for yourself
--------------------

To start the webserver for testing,
  $ python website/manage.py

You will need Django installed.  On a Debian- or Ubuntu-based system,
it may suffice (untested) to run
  $ sudo apt-get install python-django
