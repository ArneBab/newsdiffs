<h1>Press</h1>

<p>We've been very fortunate to get some press around what started as a weekend project! Here are some of the highlights.</p>

"An Insider's View of Changes, From Outside" by Arthur S. Brisbane.</strong><br>
The "journalistic sausage-making process on display is fascinating, raises many questions for critics to seize upon and, I believe, puts pressure on The Times to offer its own accounting of its coverage.Why do so many changes appear in continuous news coverage? What justifies a change? Those are questions that need answering, especially now that the changes are so visible to readers."

"NewsDiffs follows in the tradition of ProPublica's ChangeTracker, which lets you track changes to pages on the White House website, and the recently announced Politwoops from the Sunlight Foundation, which lets you track the tweets deleted by Twitter accounts belonging to politicians. The common thread that run between these tools is they expose changes or capture deleted content that is otherwise rarely visible or trackable by the public."

<br>"So far the app has turned up mostly minor but interesting differences." (Well, it was early. First day of running. The better stuff came later)

<br>"NewsDiffs solves a fundamental problem with the minute-by-minute news cycle — changes are happening constantly and subtly with no form of documentation for those changes. A reader could stumble upon a homepage during breaking news, then come back a few minutes later to a different-looking page that reflects the most recent developments on that particular story. There’s no way to easily detect what exactly has changed since you last visited the site.  Because of the concept of “writing through” articles that live on one URL (as many news organizations do), those developments get completely lost over time.
As a homepage producer at The Seattle Times, I see this problem daily. Stories develop rapidly and, wanting to ensure that readers have the most up-to-date information, we update prior versions of a story and homepage centerpieces to reflect the most recent information. But there’s a story to be told in the revisions leading up to the most recent version of an article. Small details that were important at one point in time may disappear to be replaced by more important details. Wording might be changed to be more politically correct after a quick rush to get information out there. Sometimes errors or typos can get quickly changed, and those changes don’t always end up with a story-level correction to alert readers that something incorrect was once out there."
