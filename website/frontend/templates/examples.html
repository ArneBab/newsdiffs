		<br>By RACHEL DONADIO on June 17, 2012	
		<br>The following paragraph was <strong>removed</strong>: "The fact that Syriza did not place first may make European 
leaders 
more 
likely to grant some concessions to Greece, but they also have to consider the larger economies of Spain and Italy, which are also under intense pressure."

<br>By ASHLEY PARKER on June 18, 2012
<br>The following paragraph was <strong>removed</strong>: "Al Gore was so stilted in 2000 that his campaign, trying to warm him up, paid the feminist writer Naomi Wolf for sartorial advice: earth tones for the man who wrote “Earth in the Balance.”" And this correction <strong>added</strong>: "An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the role of Naomi Wolf in Al Gore’s 2000 presidential campaign. She was a consultant on women’s issues and outreach to young voters; she was not Mr. Gore’s image consultant and did not give him sartorial advice."
