<h3>	
NewsDiffs allows you to <a href="http://newsdiffs.org/browse">compare evolving versions</a> of online news 
articles after they are published. Currently, we track <a href="http://nytimes.com">The New York Times</a>, <a 
href="http://cnn.com">CNN</a>, and <a href="http://www.politico.com">Politico.</a> It's inspired by and built on version control software, Git, 
used 
in 
computer 
programming.</h3>
<p>
<p>The New York Times Public Editor, who has <a href="http://nyti.ms/N0VvMq">discussed the importance of tracking major revisions 
and changes</a> in the digital age, recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/opinion/sunday/article-changes-are-shown-in-a-tool-created-by-outsiders.html?_r=1">highlighted NewsDiffs</a> in a column.
  		
<p>Sometimes the changes are minor â€” small edits in language or correction of spelling mistakes. Other times, the stories change and evolve rapidly, as a result of breaking news. 
			Occasionally, the lede and substance of an article change as more reporting comes in on a fast breaking 
situation. Sometimes those changes <a href="https://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/10/why_did_the_new_1.php">provoke  
criticism</a>. 
<p>

 		
			<p>NewsDiffs tracking began on June 17, 2012, as the project was inspired by the <a href="http://opennews-mit.eventbrite.com/">Knight 
Mozilla MIT Hackathon.</a> What you see here was done in 38 hours (including sleep). It was <a 
href="http://www.newsdiffs.org/about/">inspired by a variety of 
reasons</a>

			<p>You can <a href="http://newsdiffs.org/browse/">browse</a> our repository of articles.
			<p>Or you can take a look at <a href="http://newsdiffs.org/examples/">some of the examples</a> of articles that have changed.
			<p>If you are so inclined, you can <a href="http://newsdiffs.org/subscribe/">subscribe</a> to whatever it is that we may eventually send 
out some time in the future. Or you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/newsdiffs">NewsDiffs</a> on Twitter, which is probably easier for everyone 
involved.</a> 
<p> And no, the site is not really mobile-friendly (scrolling in article view doesn't work).

<em>The frontpage originally hosted a well known image that showed how the New York Times shifted its lead in the arrests of the 
Occupy Wall Street protestors on the Brooklyn Bridge. After some deliberation and discussion we decided 
to take it down since we didn't agree with the aggressive commentary text, even though the virality of that image partially 
inspired this project.</em>
