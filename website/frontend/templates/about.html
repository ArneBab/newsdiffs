			<h3>Why NewsDiffs Exists</h3> 

			<p>In the age of rapidly reporting, digital news, there is rarely a single "final" version of an article.
			<p>For better or worse, readers can now view "the making of the sausage" that historically was discretely tucked away from view with dead-tree editions.
			<p>Thus NewDiffs was born of the <a href="http://opennews-mit.eventbrite.com/">Knight Mozilla MIT hackathon</a> on June 17, 2012. 

			<p>
			<p>NewsDiffs watches different versions of highly-placed articles on online news sites, starting with <a href="http://nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a>. 

			<p>Sometimes the changes are simply minor, small edits that are tightening of (such as "most" to "many.")

			<p>Other times, the changes reflect choices in connotation for example, whether <a href="http://ecprice.scripts.mit.edu/newsdiffer/diffview?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/world/middleeast/egyptian-presidential-vote-enters-second-day.html&v1=c21d75799d83220e7ec796a198f782b6c57e1758&v2=d2778475ba76046b0f5b05bb4df2640962442dad">an election was "democratic" vs. "competitive."</a>
			<p>In still others, the lead and the substance of the articles can substantially change, such as in the story that inspired this project: the article about the arrests of Occupy Wall Street protestors on October 1, 2011 that is pictured above. Two versions, twenty minutes apart, had substantially different first paragraphs, shifting responsibility for the conflicts and arrests.</p>

			<p>
			<p> Another interesting example would have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-is-killed.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all">the killing of Osama Bin Laden</a> on May 1, 2011, which broke at 10:40 p.m. with a sparse report from Helene Cooper: 
			<blockquote>WASHINGTON â€” Osama bin Laden has been killed, a United States official said. President Obama is expected to make an announcement on Sunday night, almost 10 years after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</blockquote>
			
			<h3>Why is This Called NewsDiffs?</h3>
			
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">Diffing</a> is a popular concept within computer programming, which outputs the differences between two files. It is typically used to show the changes between one version of a file and a former version of the same file. This idea of version control is well known within computer engineering, and <a href="http://www.greglinch.com/2010/07/quick-thoughts-on-journalism-and-version-control.html">should be used in journalism</a> as it moves into a constantly evolving versions of news stories.. 
			We have had many sessions at many newsy foo and bar camps on <a href="http://danielbachhuber.com/2011/04/30/bcni-philly-github-for-news/">"Github for news."</a> Well, this time, we literally did.
			
			<h3>How NewDiffs Works</h3> 
			<p>NewsDiffs regularly looks at the stories that are linked to (or have been linked to) from the homepage of major online news publications, starting with <a href="http://nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a>. It parses them and stores them in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">git repository</a>. 
			<p>The front end used to view the differences is courtesy from the open-source project, <a href="http://mergely.com/">mergely</a>, by <a href="email:jamie.peabody@gmail.com">Jamie Peabody</a>.				
			<p>The records start June 17, 2012. 
			<p>Not all articles are stored. Only those with changes are displayed.
			<p>NewsDiffs focuses mostly on ones that are linked from the homepage.
			
			<h3>Who made NewsDiffs?</h3> 
			<p>NewsDiffs is the product of a weekend of work from the <a href="http://opennews-mit.eventbrite.com/">Knight Mozilla MIT hackathon</a>. 
by <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/">Eric Price</a>, <a href="http://jennifer8lee.com">Jennifer 8. Lee</a> and <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~price/">Greg Price</a>. 
<p>Greg and Eric, who are brothers, have both placed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest">world ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest</a>,as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics">International Olympiad in Informatics</a>, the world competition for high school students.

<p>Greg, who works at <a href="http://tddium">Tddium</a>, has his masters in theoretical computer science from MIT and a bachelors in mathematics from Harvard. Eric is currently in his third year of a PhD in theoretical computer science from MIT. 
<p>Jenny was a reporter at The New York Times for nine years and has been tortured by missing semicolons in her life.
